# Polygon-Construction-Using-Turtlesim-and-Ros
This project involves creating a system to draw polygons using the Turtlesim simulator in ROS, leveraging a client-server architecture. The system allows a user to specify the number of sides of the polygon, and the Turtlesim node will draw the corresponding polygon on the screen.

Environments used:
Linux
Python 3.8
Rospy
